# General

This code is based on Genetic Algorithm proposed in [Ai Game for Developers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596005559.do) where code is made in C++, this version is made in JavaScript and this is not using any library only Canvas from HTML5. You doesn't need local server for run this sample.

This version has some elements in portuguese (my native language), I would like to translate to english when I has time :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:, but if you dont speak portuguese, keep calm I guess which you can understand, too.

You can see this code is running [here](https://tushn.github.io/Genetic-Agorithm-Flowers-Example-JS/AI_World.html).
